Blocks puzzle
Your niece was given a set of blocks for her birthday, and she has decided to build a panel using 
3×1 and 4.5×1" blocks. For structural integrity, the spaces between the blocks must not line up
in adjacent rows. For example, the 13.5×3 panel below is unacceptable, because some of the 
spaces between the blocks in the first two rows line up (as indicated by the dotted line).
There are 2 ways in which to build a 7.5×1 panel, 2 ways to build a 7.5×2 panel, 4 ways to 
build a 12×3 panel, and 7958 ways to build a 27×5 panel. How many different ways are there 
for your niece to build a 48×10 panel? The answer will fit in a 64-bit integer. Write a program to 
calculate the answer. 
The program should be non-interactive and run as a single-line command which takes two 
command-line arguments, width and height, in that order. Given any width between 3 and 48 that 
is a multiple of 0.5, inclusive, and any height that is an integer between 1 and 10, inclusive, your 
program should calculate the number of valid ways there are to build a wall of those dimensions. 
Your programs output should simply be the solution as a number, with no line-breaks or white 
spaces.
Your program will be judged on how fast it runs and how clearly the code is written. We will be 
running your program as well as reading the source code, so anything you can do to make this 
process easier would be appreciated.
Send the source code and let us know the value that your  program computes, your programs 
running time, and the kind of machine on which you ran it.


Solution for a 48x10 Panel: 806844323190414
Running time: 				0.035 seconds
System:						Intel i5-2410M 2.3GHz, 4GB RAM, 64bit Win 7

after some online reasearch
found a C version runs in 0.1s
      a Java that hangs when height over 8
      a Pearl version runs in 6.58s
      a Haskell version runs in 0.5s 

Requirements to run the program:
Node.js needs to be installed; 
	which can be downloaded for free from: 	http://www.nodejs.org/#download
After install, just use a terminal to excute: 
	node ~path/athena.txt 48 10 	
Or you can just copy the whole text and paste it in Chrome's Inspect Element console, 
but it may become slower to execute and you have to manually change the sampleWidth
and the sampleHeight values below for the desired values.
(may aslo work in firefox firebug <- not tested)
